Cooking-Inventory-Management-System

Developed an inventory management software for freelance chefs using Python Tkinter and SQLite 3, streamlining user login, inventory, order tracking, and financial reporting.
Enabled timely deliveries, increased order capacity, and expedited cost and revenue calculations, significantly improving operational efficiency.

The frontend of this application was developed using Python Tkinter and the backend was developed using SQlite 3 database.
The application also performs validation checks and does error handeling.
It also has a login page.

The application was built personally for the customer and has been personalised for their needs.
There has been a formal process of user testing and improvement on the application based on the user feedback.

Finally the application was well documented and delivered to the user.
