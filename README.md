# Cooking-Inventory-Management-System
Developed inventory management software for freelance chefs using Python Tkinter for frontend development and SQLite 3 database to store user data.
The system includes user login, inventory, order and menu tracking, and report generation with total
profit, cost, and revenue calculations.
Tracking system led to punctual deliveries, expanded order capacity for chefs, and faster cost and
revenue calculations.
